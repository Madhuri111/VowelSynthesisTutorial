# VowelSynthesisTutorial

Our tutorial will cover speech synthesis, which corresponds to Chapter 8 in the 2nd edition. We will have students synthesize vowels in Python using their formants via the open-source AudioLazy toolbox (using this example script for inspiration https://github.com/danilobellini/audiolazy/blob/master/examples/formants.py). We will have them examine the effect of shifting the formants on perceived voice pitch (ie: male vs female and child) and the effect of using a different number of formants on vowel quality/intelligibility (ie: 2 vs 1 and 3). Finally, we will have them programmatically sweep between two vowels in a loop by interpolating between their formants, then have them sweep through the entire vowel quadrilateral as was done in class.
